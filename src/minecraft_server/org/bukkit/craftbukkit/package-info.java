/**
 * This package contains classes that have the same names as the ones in CB 1060.
 * They extend LilyBukkit's own implementations of the Bukkit API, thus allowing to use plugins that were developed with
 * CraftBukkit 1060 as a dependency.
 * <br>
 * If the class does not have an implementation in LilyBukkit, it will <i>usually</i>
 * throw an {@link java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException} with a message describing what part of the API was
 * attempted to be called.
