# LilyBukkit-Preview2
A backport of LilyBukkit server core for Alpha 1.0.16.05 Unr.Preview2.

We use [RetroMCP-Java](https://github.com/MCPHackers/RetroMCP-Java) for decompilation and building.

> **Please note the following:**  
> LilyBukkit-Preview2 (as opposed to [LilyBukkit-QA](https://github.com/LilyBukkit/LilyBukkit-QA)) is closer to a direct fork of CraftBukkit rather an adaptation of it.  
> It is done mainly for testing purposes to compare the performance and stability of both versions.  
> After a certain amount of testing the better approach will be applied to both versions, so expect major changes in either of the versions after LB-Preview2's completion.
